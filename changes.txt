CHANGES MADE IN Python FILE:
ADD A GET METHOD TOO.
* As we are both sending data to backend and receiving it back.
* We have to enable both GET and POST Methods.

DO NOT USE args, use form instead, get will be as usual.

CHANGES MADE IN HTML FILE:
in form tag, fill action = "/" as the input control 
belongs to home page only.
and we have to add method = "post", as we are 
postion our data to the backend.
